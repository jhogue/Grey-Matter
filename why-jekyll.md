Reasons to use a Jekyll Wireframe System
========================================

* Supports `.md` as well as `.html` or `.xml` files. Mix and match as needed. 
* Supports partials for repetitive elements, like header, footer and navigation. 
* Written with a clean and unobtrusive `{{ double brace }}` syntax.
* Supports typical `for` directives, which makes repetitive coding easier. 
* [Has many built in output filters](https://gist.github.com/smutnyleszek/9803727#output) to sort arrays and filter strings.
* Supports a simple date-based blog. [More details here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). [Jekyll even supports the idea of Draft posts!](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/)
* Supports [categories and tags](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/) with archive pages. 
* Built-in support for [syntax highlighting of code snippets](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#highlighting-code-snippets) using either Pygments or Rouge.
* [Support for data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) (CSV, JSON or YAML) to drive dynamic lists of content. 

#Oomph Scaffold
Pull the [latest Oomph SASS Scaffold](https://github.com/oomphinc/scss-scaffold) and insert it into this project at `_sass`. This will help enssure that the code coming out of the wireframe can be inserted right into the project as development on WordPress or Drupal begins. 

#Bourbon and Neat
These libraries/tools help get us going quicker, and are required by the Oomph SASS Scaffold. Additionally, using [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/) [Empties](http://empties.bourbon.io/) can help us start faster with common markup patterns. 

#Font Awesome
We also include a CDN link to the full Font Awesome set of icons. [Reference guide is here](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/). This helps us use icons quickly, and apply a custom set later as we define which icons we need. [A list of the icons that this project uses should be made here]('/icons').
