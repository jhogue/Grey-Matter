## Grey Matter

Grey Matter is a start for stand-alone wireframe projects. Inspired by [Distillery](https://github.com/thinkshout/distillery/tree/master/) (and now heavily updated/modified), built and served with Jekyll, leveraging Oomph SASS Scaffold&hellip; [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/) help get us up and running with minimal styles and standard best-practice markup.


### Getting started
To get up and running:


#### Install dependencies
Navigate to this folder in your Terminal, then:

```
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
```

+Note: you may need to run the installers using the `$ sudo` command depending on the permissions of your computer.


#### Run the Local server and SASS compiler
From the project root, run: 

`$ jekyll serve`

The server is available at `http://localhost:4040/grey-matter/` or  `http://0.0.0.0:4040/grey-matter/`. 

If the compiled file URLs need to have a different root path, change the `baseurl` value in  `_config` and restart the server. The web url will change as well, i.e. `http://localhost:4040/project`. When you upload the sites content to a server, all URLs will be prefixed with `/project`.


### Usage
Any folder prefixed with an underscore is used as a build folder only, it is not compiled and rendered. An `assets` or `files` folder (unprefixed) will be included in the build. Additional files that should be excluded from the build should be added to `_config.yml`.

Use `_includes` like you would use partials in PHP for repetitive elements like headers, footer, nav, etcâ€¦

Use `_layouts` to control larger templates. Jekyll ships with an example page and a post. Variables use a {% raw %}`{% double brace %}`{% endraw %} syntax, and refer to simple text declarations at the top of page files. 

`default.html` is the base template and includes calls for a header and footer. `page.html` is a partial, which renders where the {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} call is made.

Page files live at the site root. All rendered HTML and assets go into the `_site` folder by default, from which they are served in your browser. Pages can also be nested in folders and will be rendered as such.

[Refills]({{ 'refills' | prepend: site.baseurl }}) components are included in this repo as Prototyping patterns.
